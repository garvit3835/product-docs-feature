# Cloud Run

Connecting to GCP Cloud Run Service from your DevBox.

If you're more of a visual learner, check out the [video tutorial](#video-walkthrough)!

## Architecture Diagram

<!-- markdown-link-check-disable-next-line -->
[GCP Cloud Run](https://cloud.google.com/run/docs) is a serverless service offered by GCP to manage a computing platform that enables you to run invocable containers via requests or events.
In this, we will set up a pipeline for our project within DevBox; it will be routed through Cloud Run. Then, depending on the type of project, we can either access it through the web or through the internal VPC of Google Cloud Infrastructure.

## Existing Cloud Run Application

If you have an existing Cloud Run Container deployed, follow the steps below to access its content from the DevBox. Ensure the Cloud Run Deployment has the `Require authentication` option selected in the **Security** section.

### Step 1: Creating a Recipe

First, we need to create a recipe for the workspace:

1. Go to the [DevZero Dashboard > Recipes](https://www.devzero.io/dashboard/recipes) and click on **New recipe**.
2. Enter the recipe name and click on **Create a recipe**.
3. Now use the below-provided snippet to create a recipe for your workspace:

{% code lineNumbers="false" %}
```
version: "3"

build:
  steps:
    - type: apt-get
      packages: ["build-essential", "curl", "git", "nano", "software-properties-common", "ssh", "sudo", "tar", "unzip", "vim", "wget", "zip", "python3", "libpython3-dev"]
    - type: command
      command: |
        sudo apt-get update
        sudo apt-get install apt-transport-https ca-certificates gnupg curl
        curl https://packages.cloud.google.com/apt/doc/apt-key.gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/cloud.google.gpg
        echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/cloud.google.gpg] https://packages.cloud.google.com/apt cloud-sdk main" | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list.d/google-cloud-sdk.list
        sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install google-cloud-cli
```
{% endcode %}

4. Click on **Save and Build** and when the build is successful, click on **Publish**.

### Step 2: Creating a Workspace

1. Go to the [Devzero Dashboard > Workspaces](https://www.devzero.io/dashboard/workspaces) by clicking **New workspace**.
2. Enter the workspace name and click on **Select from recipe library**.
3. Select the recipe you just created above and click on **Select**.
4. Click on **Launch**, and your workspace will be ready shortly.

### Step 3: Setting up cloud SDK

Now, this is where the real task begins. After downloading the `gcloud` package, we must authenticate with our Google Cloud account. To do this, we need to run the simple command.

{% code overflow="wrap" lineNumbers="false" %}
```
gcloud init
```
{% endcode %}

After running the command, you will be given various options for choosing your **Google account**, default **Project**, and default **Compute Region and Zone**. You can choose what you prefer.

### Step 4: Accessing the Container

To access your Cloud Run container privately, you need to send a `GET` request with an authentication token.

Follow the below steps to generate the Authentication token and access the Cloud Run application:

1. Use the below command to get the token:

{% code overflow="wrap" lineNumbers="false" %}
```
gcloud auth print-identity-token
```
{% endcode %}

2. Export the token to an environmental variable:

{% code overflow="wrap" lineNumbers="false" %}
```
export TOKEN=$(gcloud auth print-identity-token)
```
{% endcode %}

3. Now that everything is set, we can finally finish this all off by accessing the applications with the `curl` command:

{% code overflow="wrap" lineNumbers="false" %}
```
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer ${TOKEN}" <cloud-run-application-endpoint-url>
```
{% endcode %}

## New Cloud Run Application

If you want to create a new Cloud Run Container, you can follow the below steps.

### Step 1: Creating the Container

1. Go to **Cloud Run > Services** and click **Deploy Container**.
2. Choose a deployment method between **Deploy one revision from an existing container image**, **Continuously deploy from a repository (source or function)**.

{% hint style="info" %}
We are creating a container with an existing demo image for this guide.
{% endhint %}

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Existing Image"%}
3. Enter your **Container Image URL** or select by clicking on **Select**.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Deploy from repository" %}
3. Click on **Set Up with Cloud Build** and follow the instructions.
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

4. Then Enter your **Service Name** and **Region** of deployment.
5. Select **Require authentication** option in the **Authentication** section.
6. Leave the remaining configurations as default and click on **Create**.
