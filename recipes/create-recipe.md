## 3. Select Repository
From here, you can choose to use a public Github repository by providing a URL or you can authenticate to our Github App to select a private repository.

Alternatively, you can launch a blank Recipe by clicking "Create a recipe" without providing a code repo.

If you're not using GitHub or prefer a different authentication method, check out this section on [cloning source code](clone-source-code.md).
{% endhint %}

## 4. Make Recipe Changes
Make desired changes to your Recipe, select Save and Build to initiate the build process, verifying successful recipe compilation. To streamline recipe creation, we offer suggested steps based on an analysis of your code.

 We provide detailed build logs to help you identify any errors in your build and make iterating on Recipes easy.
{% endhint %}

## 5. Publish Your Recipe
After you've successfully build your Recipe and are done iterating, you're ready to Publish the recipe to your Recipe Library.
